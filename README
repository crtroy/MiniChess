Board information was inspired by www.chessbin.org

Pieces and placement are represented by integer arrays. One for the black pieces and one for the white pieces.
If array hold -1, then piece has been removed from board.
All pieces start at -1, which means they are not on the board.
Board placement is decided at the start of the game.
Queen positions 9 - 14 are reserved for pawn promotion.
                                                                  Pawn Promotion

    int[]   whitePieces = {-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1,| -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1,|  -1};
                                                              |                        |

    int[]   blackPieces = {-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1,| -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1,|  -1};
                                                              {------------------------}

    This position in the array id's the piece. The number in that array position is where it is located on the board.
    So blackPieces[5] = 27 means the Black Rook is on board position 28, or "d-1".

piece representation on board:
    White: pawns = 1   rook = 11   knight = 21   bishop = 31   queen = 41   king = 51
    Black: pawns = 2   rook = 12   knight = 22   bishop = 32   queen = 42   king = 52

board position mod 10 decides what color piece is being removed.
if pos = 22, that's a Black knight.
so 22 % 10 = 2, so we know it's a black piece.


The board is just a integer array. If the array position == 0, then the position is empty.
Otherwise the position is represented by a piece number.

Row is found by taking the floor of the board / 5.
Row = (int)(position / 5)

    0/5 = 0   = 0   5/5 = 1     = 1
    1/5 = 0.2 = 0   6/5 = 1.2   = 1
    2/5 = 0.4 = 0   7/5 = 1.4   = 1
    3/5 = 0.6 = 0   8/5 = 1.6   = 1
    4/5 = 0.8 = 0   9/5 = 1.8   = 1

Column is found by taking the floor of the board % 5.
Column = (position % 5)
    column a = 0
    column b = 1
    column c = 2
    column d = 3
    column e = 4

   ----------------
    a  b  c  d  e
Pawn...
pawn can attack at +4 and + 6
pawn can move forward at +5
if pawn == 6 || pawn == 11 || pawn == 16 || pawn == 21
Could also say:
if pawn%5 == 0 no right attack is valid:: pawn can attack at +4 and move at +5
else if pawn%5 == 1 no left attack is valid:: pawn can attack at +6 and move at +5
else pawn can attack at +4 or +6 and move at +5

Knight....
Knights start at positions 4 and 27
This is the full range of moves for knights
